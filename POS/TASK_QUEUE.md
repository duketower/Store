# POS Task Queue

## Current

- Keep POS and `POS/platform/` docs in sync
- Keep the dashboard target/profit docs aligned with the live app behavior
- Keep the multi-device hardening work focused on store-critical data before secondary modules
- Use `MULTI_DEVICE_ROADMAP.md` as the source of truth for the remaining full-store sync rollout

## Next

- Finish validating Phase 1, Phase 2, and the started Phase 3 work from `MULTI_DEVICE_ROADMAP.md`
- Then complete RTVs, shared settings, attendance, and auth in roadmap order
- Re-test every report tab on a second device after each phase, not only at the end

## Done

- Moved multi-client build tooling into `POS/platform/`
- Added project-level planning and architecture docs
- Fixed the current TypeScript build blockers in billing/report code
- Added a startup loading screen for the POS boot flow
- Switched the main store custom domain target to `pos.binaryventures.in`
- Added shared dashboard targets, shared expense sync, and profit/break-even tracking
- Added month selection to the dashboard month-performance block
- Added a clear default rule to deploy the main-store client after app changes
- Added a visible pending-sync queue and idempotent replay path for core live-store sync events
- Added a dedicated roadmap for full multi-device coverage across every POS module
